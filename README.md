# BEPs: BNB Evolution Proposals

opBNB is a layer-2 scaling solution for the BNB Smart Chain, constructed on the foundation of decentralized governance and driven by the aspirations of its community. This Provisional Governance Framework provides the structure for sustainable, adaptable, and democratic governance that's built to endure and evolve.

Recognizing the complexity and unpredictability of the future, opBNB embarks on this journey with a Provisional Governance Framework that will adapt and grow iteratively over time. The Framework will be reassessed and refined every four years to accommodate lessons learned and new dynamics within the ecosystem.

The BNB Foundation, an autonomous organization, will coordinate the growth and development of opBNB. The Foundation will manage governance operations, allocate treasury assets for ecosystem growth, amend the Provisional Governance Framework, and gradually transition its responsibilities to the community, fostering a more decentralized model over time.

BNB communities are granted the right to participate in the ecosystem's decision-making processes. This includes the right to propose and vote on significant changes, delegate their decision-making rights to others, and receive delegation from others, ensuring a sense of collective ownership and participatory democracy. 

opBNB is committed to positive and progressive development. We believe in the power of our community to overcome challenges and create a more inclusive, efficient, and prosperous ecosystem. BEP stands for BNB Evolution Proposal. Each BEP will be a proposal document providing information to the BNB Chain ecosystem and community.
